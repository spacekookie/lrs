Still early in development. Might break at any time for no reason. And all functionality not guaranteed. Have patience :)

## What is this?

This is a crate that allows you to quickly (eh...more or less) solve logical equations (clauses) in conjunctive normal form for solvability.

This README is a stub for the repo for now. There are two crates here: the library which does all the heavy lifting and a cli tool which can be used to quickly resolve clauses in the terminal.

If you want to learn more about this check out the excellent [wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resolution_(logic))
