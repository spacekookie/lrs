# Logical Resolution Solver

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/spacekookie/lrs.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/spacekookie/lrs) [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/k7cvf2pvxbr0vhgi/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/spacekookie/lrs/branch/master) 

This is a crate that allows you to quickly (eh...more or less) solve logical equations (clauses) in conjunctive normal form for solvability.

This README is a stub for the repo for now. There are two crates here: the library which does all the heavy lifting and a cli tool which can be used to quickly resolve clauses in the terminal.
